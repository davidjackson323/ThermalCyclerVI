# ThermalCyclerVI

During the summer of 2023 the students at College of the Desert developed a custom automation solution for our Environmental Simulation Lab to test out Exquadrum's propietary cubesat solutions. Our program allowed us to to conduct thermal cycling tests to simulate orbital conditions that a satellite would under go in low earth orbit. We used labview to interface to our chaambers controller (Synergy Nano 2) so that we could control the temperature directly through a comm port. The resulting LabVIEW VI that we developed gave us full control in terms of cycle time, number of cycles to complete, high temperature and low temperature exposure all while data logging the temperaure of the device and the chamber. We are able to test devices from a range of -200C to 500C. Our solution allows for long term testing with no supervision, and greatly reduced the complexity of operation of the machine.
